    /**
     * Returns an async generator that yields mouse events of a specific type.
     *
     * This method provides a convenient way to iterate over mouse events using async/await syntax.
     * The async generator will yield events as they occur, allowing for clean and readable event handling code.
     *
     * **Cancellation with AbortSignal:** The async generator supports cancellation through the `signal` option.
     * When the provided AbortSignal is aborted, the generator will throw a `MouseError` and clean up all listeners.
     * This is particularly useful for implementing timeout functionality or user-initiated cancellation.
     *
     * **Queue Management:**
     * - By default, events are queued up to `maxQueue` (default: 100, max: 1000)
     * - When `latestOnly` is true, only the most recent event is buffered, dropping intermediate events
     * - This is useful for high-frequency events like 'move' where you only care about the latest position
     *
     * **Error Handling:** Errors from the mouse event stream will be thrown from the generator,
     * allowing for try/catch error handling in the iteration loop.
     *
     * **Cleanup:** The generator automatically cleans up event listeners when:
     * - The iteration loop completes (breaks or returns)
     * - An error is thrown
     * - The abort signal is triggered
     *
     * @param type The type of mouse event to listen for (e.g., 'press', 'drag', 'wheel').
     * @param options Configuration for the event stream.
     * @param options.latestOnly If true, only the latest event is buffered. Defaults to false.
     * @param options.maxQueue The maximum number of events to queue. Defaults to 100, with a maximum of 1000.
     * @param options.signal An AbortSignal to cancel the async generator and clean up resources.
     * @yields {MouseEvent} A mouse event object containing x, y, button, and action properties.
     * @throws {MouseError} When the abort signal is triggered or a mouse event stream error occurs.
     *
     * @example
     * ```ts
     * const mouse = new Mouse();
     * mouse.enable();
     *
     * // Collect 5 mouse clicks
     * const clicks: MouseEvent[] = [];

     *   if (clicks.length >= 5) break;
     * }
     * mouse.disable();
     * ```
     *
     * @example
     * ```ts
     * // Track mouse movement with cancellation after 5 seconds
     * const controller = new AbortController();
     * setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 5000);
     *
     * try {

     *     throw err;
     *   }

     * Returns an async generator that yields move events at most once per specified interval.
     *
     * This method provides debounced move events, reducing event frequency for smooth animations
     * and performance optimization. Unlike `eventsOf('move')` which yields every move event,
     * this method waits for a quiet period before emitting, ensuring you only get events at
     * a controlled rate.
     *
     * **Debouncing Behavior:**
     * - Move events are collected during the debounce interval
     * - Only the most recent event is yielded after the interval elapses
     * - If the mouse continues moving, the timer restarts with each new event
     * - This is ideal for UI updates, animations, and position tracking where you want
     *   to avoid excessive redraws
     *
     * **Cancellation with AbortSignal:** The async generator supports cancellation through
     * the `signal` option. When the provided AbortSignal is aborted, the generator will stop
     * immediately and clean up all listeners.

     * **Cleanup:** The generator automatically cleans up event listeners and timers when:

     * ```ts
     * // Debounced move events with cancellation

     * @param options Configuration options for the wait operation.
     * @param options.timeout Maximum time to wait in milliseconds. Defaults to 30000 (30 seconds).
     * @param options.signal An AbortSignal to cancel the operation early.
     * @returns A promise that resolves with the x, y coordinates.
     * @throws {MouseError} If timeout is exceeded or operation is aborted.
     *
     * @example
     * ```ts
     * const mouse = new Mouse();
     * mouse.enable();
     *
     * try {
     *   // If mouse has moved, returns immediately
     *   // Otherwise waits for first move event
     *   const { x, y } = await mouse.getMousePosition();
     *   console.log(`Mouse is at ${x}, ${y}`);
     * } finally {
     *   mouse.disable();
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * @example
     * ```ts
     * // Get position without waiting (after mouse has moved)
     * mouse.on('move', () => {
     *   // This will resolve immediately since we have a cached position
     *   mouse.getMousePosition().then(({ x, y }) => {
     *     console.log(`Current position: ${x}, ${y}`);
     *   });
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * @example
     * ```ts
     * // Use with custom timeout
     * const { x, y } = await mouse.getMousePosition({ timeout: 5000 });
     * ```
